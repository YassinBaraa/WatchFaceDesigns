After the above:
	Tizen Studio began to successfully launch the Samsung Account login page!
	I was able to generate certificates at Tools->Certificate Manager->Add New->Samsung->Mobile/Wearable:
	Created a new certificate profile (which I named “Rita”)
	Created a new author certificate and left the “Apply the same password” box checked
	Clicked OK and the Samsung Login Portal appeared in Chrome alongside a window with a 5-minute timer
	When my login was successful, the page redirected to http://localhost:4794/signin/callback 58 which displayed “Login Successful. Please continue on the Certificate Manager UI”
	Created a new distributor certificate
	Selected my paired Galaxy Watch Active2’s DUID which automatically appeared in the list


Closed Tizen Studio, then found certificate files in C:\Users\Spurdo\SamsungCertificate\Rita.
	Copied all the contents of C:\Users\Spurdo\SamsungCertificate\Rita to three locations, after removing any preexisting files from the other locations:
	C:\Program Files\Galaxy Watch Studio\tizen\keystore
	C:\Users\Spurdo\GearWatchDesigner\keystore
	C:\Users\Spurdo\Downloads\Fit2Installer\cert


Opened/created my Rita.gws file in Galaxy Watch Studio

	Clicked Project->Build
	Yes and Generate to AOD popups
	Clicked Project->Build again
	Yes to save project
	Typed the author certificate password
	Clicked build
	Clicked OK on “Warning signing fail keystore password was incorrect” popup (ignore)
	Closed Galaxy Watch Studio


This time, Galaxy Watch Studio was able to generate C:\Users\Spurdo\Rita_TW5.tpk (D:\Programming\WatchFace)
	Moved Rita_TW5.tpk to C:\Users\Spurdo\Downloads\Fit2Installer\sign_me
	Held down Shift and while holding Shift, right-clicked in the Fit2Installer folder
	Clicked “Open PowerShell window here”
	Typed .\sdb.exe connect 192.168.120.64:26101 because 192.168.120.64 was my Galaxy 	Watch Active2’s IP address
	Typed .\sign.bat
	Entered the certificate password again
	Typed .\install.bat


On Galaxy Watch Active2:
	Pressed the home button and touched Settings->Apps->Permissions->Rita->Sensors toggle ON. It took me a long time to realize that apps sideloaded this way cannot access 	Samsung Health Service data unless you do that every time you install them.
	Pressed the home button and touched Settings->Watch Faces->Rita
	Finally I am able to see my watch face from Galaxy Watch Studio on the Galaxy Watch Active2 screen!
